Allows you to change the Genesis footer credits from the Genesis Theme Settings page.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a section to the Genesis Theme Settings page where users can enter HTML to output in the site footer in place of the default Genesis footer credits. You can use any of the existing Genesis footer shortcodes, your own HTML, or just simple text.

Please note: If your child theme has a function for a custom footer already, it will override the plugin’s settings. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire genesis-custom-footer folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. In your Genesis Theme Setting menu, customize your footer from the “Custom Footer Text” box.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I entered custom text but I don’t see it on my site. Why not? =

Some Genesis child themes have a custom footer function defined in functions.php. If you don’t see the text you entered, check your functions.php for a custom footer function and comment it out by entering // before each line of code related to that function. Need help? Please contact us!
